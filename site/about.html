<p>	I'm Silas Dillay, a software and graphic developer. 
I live in Denver, Colorado and moved here when I was 19 to live on my own.
Ever since, I've been pursuing a life in programming and art focused on user interface and design.
I've been drawing since I could pick up a pencil and I was introduced to digital art when I was about 16.
I draw digitally and traditionally and even know a bit about painting.
</p>

<p>As for programming, I was introduced to Scratch when I was in high school and have been in love with the logic processes ever since.
I currently have ever-developing skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I've always had an innate intrest in the way art and programming mix to make all the technology we use today, and learning and working with it is one of my favorite things to do.
</p>

<p>
I have a very customer friendly approach to work.
I'm very versatile and able to work in a group or independently while finding every job engaging and fulfilling.
I'm also very good at prioritizing work to get it done in the most efficient manner possible.
